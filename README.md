# EVChargeMate ðŸ›µ- Slot Reservation & More
EVChargeMate is a Full Stack Web Development project focused on managing and  optimizing electric vehicle charging stations. The application aims to streamline the  process of reserving charging slots and providing additional features to enhance the  overall user experience in electric vehicle charging.

# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Many electric vehicle (EV) drivers face difficulties finding available charging stations 
and reserving parking spots. This can lead to frustration, wasted time, and range 
anxiety. EVChargeMate aims to address this problem by providing a user-friendly

real-time, and reserve parking spots in advance.

# USERS OF THE APPLICATION

â€¢	EV Drivers: Individuals who own and operate electric vehicles. They require a 
platform to find charging stations, check availability, reserve spots, and 
manage their charging sessions.
â€¢	Fleet managers: Responsible for managing the charging needs of a fleet of 
EVs.
â€¢	Charging Station Owners/Operators: Businesses or organizations that 
manage and operate electric vehicle charging stations. They need a platform 
to manage station availability, receive reservation requests, monitor charging 
activity, and collect payments.
